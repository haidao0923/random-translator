[Introduction]
[Hobby 1]
I want you to stay
Look at his grave
Until it rots and dies and is buried
"When I'm in the box you're carrying."
If you go, I'll go too.
Because it is always you (okay)
If I cry, please don't save me
All that was left was my son.
[abandoned]
Birds of a feather, we must stick together
, I know
I said I never thought I was not alone
The weather doesn't change, maybe never will
But it would be better if it was forever
[Before chorus]
And I don't know why I'm crying
I don't think I could love you more.
It may not be very long, but baby, I am
[free]
I will love you till death
A sure tree
"Until the light goes out of my eyes."
Until the day I die.
[Paragraph 2]
I want you to see, hmm
I bow, hm
You won't believe it if I tell you
You will save and I will repay you with flattery
But you're so stupid, ugh.
Tell me a little about
If you don't see it, the mind becomes dirty
Say you want out, don't be a jerk
[I'm begging you]
And I don't know why I'm crying
I don't think I can love you more
Maybe not soon, but here I am, baby
You don't want to say goodbye
[Chorus]
Birds of a feather, we must stand together
I know
(until the day I die)
I said I never felt I wasn't better than I was
(Until the Light Goes Out of My Eyes)
You can't change time, maybe not forever
(Until the day I die)
But forever is even better
[Postal Code]
I met you in another life
your eyes also had the same feeling
I love you, don't be surprised
