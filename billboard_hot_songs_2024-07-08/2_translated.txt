[Section 1]
My son wants a Birkin. He said all night.
Gasoline and food, the list goes on and on
This nine to five is not work, why do I work so hard?
I can't worry about my problems, I can't take them, oh
[pre-chorus]
One, here two, three or four
Tell them to "bring another round" we need more
Two steps on the table, no need for a dance floor.
Oh my god
[chorus]
Someone pour me a double shot of whiskey.
I know Jack Daniel and they have a story
There is a party downtown near Fifth Avenue
Everyone at the bar failed
[string chorus]
Everyone in the bar is nervous
Everyone in the bar is drunk
[Rann 2]
I've been drinking since I left
I don't change checks
Tell my mother that you (God) will not forget me
I woke up at ten o'clock in the morning
We're going to make that joke again
Tell your daughter to bring a friend, oh Lord
[pre-sowing]
One, here comes three or four out of two
Tell them to "bring out the next round", we want more.
With a double step on the table he doesn't need a dance floor
Oh, good to hear that
[course]
Somebody pour me a double whiskey (Double whiskey)
They know me and have a history of Jack Daniel's (we're going to the former).
There's a party near Fifth Street
Everyone gets drunk at the bar.
[PÄ“crefren]
Everyone's drunk at the bar (they're drinking at the bar)
Everyone in the bar passed out.
[full stop]
First, here comes two to three and then four
They kick us out at last call
It's great but what do women want?
Oh Good Lord (Tell Them About Me)
[singing]
Somebody give me two whiskeys
They know that me and Jack Daniels have a (long) history.
There's a party in town near 5th avenue (Come on)
Visi empty belt (oi)
Somebody pour me a double shot of whiskey (double shot of whiskey)
They know me and Jack Daniels have history (that's Jack D)
Under the bottle you won't lose me (baby you won't lose me)
Everyone in the bar misses you (the bar misses you too)
[post course]
Everyone in the mountain got drunk
Everyone in the bar is angry.
[Other]
Damn the mess bro, I got kicked out of the bar
