[Section 1]
I can't say I'm an early riser.
It was ten before he could say a word
Honey, I never knew
How can I sleep well?
you keep telling me to live right
Sleep before noon
But you wake up because of the sunrise
I know I donâ€™t have to pretend.
Baby, sometimes
[Pre-chorus]
Like a dark lake, you don't want to wake up.
Smell of fire, lost in smoke?
If you're drunk in life, honey, I think it's okay.
But in this world
[Poison]
I think I'm keeping my whiskey in safe hands
my black coffee
And my bed is 3 o'clock
You're too sweet for me
You are very beautiful to me
I take my whiskey carefully
My black coffee and my bed at 3
You are so sweet to me
I love you so much
[after poisoning]
And and
salom salom
[chapter 2]
I mean the country
I was right

And the land is where to go
I'm working when I'm on the phone
The work is done.
But you're a little worried, I know
But who wants to live forever, baby?
You treat your mouth like the door to heaven.
Unless you are T.S.A.
I wish I could join
Don't get me wrong my dear
[seniors]
you know
bright as the morning, light in the rain
Beautiful as a grape; Sweet like grapes.
If you can sit on the bucket, I can wait.
Until today
[cor]
I prefer to take my whiskey seriously
My coffee is black and I'm in bed at 3 am
I love you
I love you so much
I drink my whiskey well
My coffee is black and I go to bed at 3 o'clock
It makes me happy
you are too beautiful for me
[postal code]
Wow, wow
Wow Wow
hi nin
Wow Wow
[it sells]
My whisky tastes good
My black coffee and my bed at 3
You are very good to me
you are so sweet
