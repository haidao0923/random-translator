[Verse 1: Post Malone]
You got a lotta nerve, don't you, baby?
I only hit the curb 'cause you made me
You're tellin' all your friends that I'm crazy
Like I'm the only one
Why'd you throw them stones if you
Had a wild hair of your own or two?
Livin' in your big glass house with a view
I thought you knew
[Chorus: Post Malone]
I had some help
It ain't like I can make this kinda mess all by myself
Don't act like you ain't help me pull that bottle off the shelf
Been deep in every weekend if you couldn't tell
They say, "Teamwork makes the dream work"
Hell, I had some help (Help)
[Post-Chorus: Post Malone]
(Help)
[Verse 2: Morgan Wallen]
You thought I'd take the blame for us a-crumbling
Go 'round like you ain't guilty of somethin'
Already lost the game that you been runnin'
Guess it's catchin' up to you, huh
You think that you're so innocent
After all the shit you did
I ain't an angel, you ain't heaven-sent
Can't wash our hands of this
[Chorus: Morgan Wallen]
I had some help
It ain't like I can make this kinda mess all by myself
Don't act like you ain't help me pull that bottle off the shelf
Been deep in every weekend if you couldn't tell
They say, "Teamwork makes the dream work"
Hell, I had some help (Help)
[Post-Chorus: Post Malone]
(Help)
(Help)
(Help)
[Bridge: Morgan Wallen,
Post Malone
&
Both
]
It takes two to break a heart in two, ooh
Baby, you blame me and, baby, I blame you
Aw, if that ain't the truth (
Oh
)
[Chorus: Post Malone & Morgan Wallen]
I had some help
It ain't like I can make this kinda mess all by myself
Don't act like you ain't help me pull that bottle off the shelf
Been deep in every weekend if you couldn't tell
They say, "Teamwork makes the dream work"
Hell, I had some help (Help)
[Post-Chorus: Post Malone]
(Help)
(Help)
(Help)
