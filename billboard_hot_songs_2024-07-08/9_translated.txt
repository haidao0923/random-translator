[Section 1]
Something has happened to me recently
No, I don't recognize myself anymore
It felt like all the walls were closed.
Satan came knocking on my door Wow!
You're out of your mind, how many times have I told you?
Am I not good enough on my own?
Yes, it is difficult for me, I will try my best
Don't you know my bones tear the skin?
[Quarter]
I can't help myself
When you are not with me
I fall before you, don't you see?
I'm losing control
When you're not near me, mm
yes i am sad
You made me laugh
[JAE 2]
problem
The problem is you love your body like a curse, like a bad habit
Bad habits that are hard to break when I'm with you
Yes, I know I can do it myself
But I want real full moon black magic and it takes two people
problem
The problem is, when I'm with you, I become addicted.
Take some comfort in knowing you have my skin in your teeth.
You cannot see the forest through the trees
I'm on my knees baby, oh
[course]
I can't avoid it
If you're not near me
I'm breaking up in front of you, don't you see?
I'm losing control.
When you're not by my side (mm-hm)
Yeah you broke my heart baby
You confuse me, yes.
[Relax device]
[short]
I don't lack control
If you're not with me, mm
I fell in front of you, don't you see?
I never lost control
If you're not with me, hmm
Yes you broke my heart, darling
It's boring
