Now he thinks of me every night
Is it that sweet? so I think
Say you can't sleep, I know
That's my expression
It's up and down, left and right, oh
Switch like Nintendo.
Say you're not sleeping, baby, I know
This is my espresso
[Section 1]
I can't handle despair
my silence is on vacation
And I have this guy, he won't stop calling.
When I did, I knew I got it
[Pre-corus]
(mm) I'm sorry your ex didn't do it for you.
(MM) Make your dreams come true
(Mm) Your skin is soft and I spray you with perfume
(Yes) I know I will give it to you in winter
(yes) I made coffee for you that morning
(Yeah) One touch, I'm new to you (Oh)
[choir]
Now she thinks about me every night, oh
It is too sweet. I think so
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
A sin is a sin expressed as a gift
Move up, down, left, right, oh
Move like Nintendo
Say you can't sleep baby, I know
This is me espresso.

[2. run]
I work late because I'm a singer
Oh, my fingers feel so good
My quirky sense of humor often makes her laugh.
Dear, we can't find this powder
[para-kori]
(Mm) I'm sorry your ex didn't do that to you.
(Mm) Come in and make your dreams come true
(Mm) Soft skin and I heard you (Ai, Ai, Ooh)
(Yes) I know it's mountain dew to you.
(Yes) With this morning coffee, it's made for you
(Yeah) One touch and I'll do it for you again (Silly)
