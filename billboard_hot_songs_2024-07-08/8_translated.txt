[Verse 1]
Things were difficult there for a while.
But lately I've been feeling better.
I remember how cold it was last December.
I see my family every month.
I found a girl my parents like
He also comes to spend the night and I think he gets everything.
I thank God every day
For the girl he gave me
But I know what he gives me, he can take away.
And I hold you every night
This is the feeling I want to get used to
But no one is as scared as a person who can lose you.
[Golden White Choir]
Wow, I hope I never lose you
Please stay.
I need you, I need you, God
Don't take it
These wonderful things I have
[Chorus]
please stay
I want you, I need you, god
Don't take it
I have good things

o They
Please do not buy
[Verse 2]
I have found my mind, I am healthy
It took a long time but I am searching for my faith
If everything is fine then why should I sit and wait until it's all over?
Oh, let me tell you, I know I've had enough
I have peace and love
But at night I go to bed feeling lost.
[poison]
please stop
I need you, Bog
Office
These are the beautiful things I love
[After chorus]
Hey hey
[Others]
Waiting
I want you, I need you, God
need
The wonderful things that I have
