[section 1]
I know I have a bad smell, and I know I have one.
It's funny and it's ironic that I feel the same way.
I am sure you are different and everyone is wrong.
But don't do it
I heard you're an actor, so act like a comedian.
Whatever demons are inside of you, don't let them out tonight
I tell them it's just your culture and they all roll their eyes
Yes I know
What should I ask the child?
[sings]
Thank you, thank you, thank you
Don't prove that I'm good
Please, please, please
Don't cry when you put on good makeup.
Heart is one thing, money is another
I beg you, don't be ashamed of me, mom, oh
Please, please, please (Ah)
[2. To]
Well, I've got a funny idea, baby (woohoo), maybe you should stay inside
I know you crave fresh air, but ceiling fans are great (cool, right?)
We are happy when no one knows you are with me
Just kidding, but really (a little), really, really
[the chorus]
Please, please, please (please don't prove me right)
Don't give me the reason
And please, please, please
Don't make me cry when I finish putting on my makeup.
Heartache is one thing (heartache is one thing), my money is another (ego is another)
Please don't embarrass me, mother, oh
good day good day (ah)
[apart from]
If you want to go, be stupid.
Don't do this in front of me
Cry to my music if you don't want to
Don't make me hate you
Please please please please)
please please please)
Please please please!
(Ah)
