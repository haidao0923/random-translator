[Paragraph 1: Post Malone]
You are very brave, aren't you, boy?
I fell in front of the curtain because you made me do it.
You tell all your friends I'm crazy
As if I were alone
Why would you throw stones at them?
Do you have a hair or two of your own?
Live in your own big glass house with a view
I think you knew
[Chorus: Post Malone]
I have help
There is no way to mess it up like that
Don't act like I didn't help you get the bottle off the shelf.
If you can't tell, go deeper every weekend
“Teamwork makes the dream come true,” he said.
hell i got help (help)

[Aya ta 2: Morgan Wallen]
You thought I took responsibility for our breakup
Pretend you didn't do anything wrong
You lost the game.
Looks like you're interested, right?
Do you think you are so innocent?
after all the bad things you have done
I'm not an angel, you're not from heaven
You can't wash your hands.
[CORO: Morgan Wallen]
I got help
I don't think I can get out of this mess alone
Don't pretend you won't help me get that bottle off the shelf.
If you can't decide, dig deeper each week.
They say "Working together makes dreams come true"
damn, i got help (help)
[Post-Chorus: Post Malone]

[Credit: Morgan Wallen,
nice post

Both

It takes two to break two hearts, oh my god
Baby you blame me and baby I blame you
Oh, if it's not true (
oh

[Cavity: Post Malone and Morgan Wallen]
I helped a little
I can't face this dilemma alone
Don't act like you're not helping me get that bottle off the shelf.
Deep wash every weekend if you can't tell
"Collaboration makes dreams come true," he said.
Hello, I got help (help)
