[Section 1]
My son wants a Birkin, she told me all night.
Gasoline and groceries, the list goes on
This nine-to-five doesn't work, why do I work so much?
I can't worry about my problems, I can't solve them after I'm gone
[face-blind]
One, here two three four
Tell them to "bring another round" we need more
Two legs on the table, no need for a dance floor
Oh my God
[Chorus]
Someone poured whiskey twice for me.
They know I have a history with Jack Daniel's
There's a party in town near 5th Street
Everyone at the bar is bored
[after chorus]
Everyone is drinking at the bar
Everyone in the bar gets advice
[Ran 2]
I've been in Boozey since I left
I will not convert to a check
Telling mom I haven't forgotten (O God).
The lamp is at 10 o'clock.
We will do it again
Tell me as much as you can, bring a friend, my god.
[group]
One, here are 2, 3 and 4.
Call it "Bring on another round", we need more
Two steps to the table, no need for a dance floor.
My God, good God
[chorus]
Somebody give me two whiskeys (two whiskeys)
They know me and have a history with Jack Daniels (we go way back).
There's a party downtown near Fifth Street
Everyone in the bar gets drunk
[Pocorus]
Munhu e mong le e mong ka har'ya bar gettin' puffin' (ka har'ya bar gettin' puffin')
Everyone at the bar gets a tip
[Punt]
One, here two, here three, here four
When the final bell rang, they kicked us out the door
It's late, but women still want it
Oh God (tell him to drink from me)
[poison]
Somebody pour me a double shot of whiskey (double shot of whiskey)
They know I have a history with Jack Daniel's (for a long time).
There's a party downtown near Fifth Avenue (quick)
Everyone in the bar is drunk (Whoah Whoah)
Someone got a double shot of whiskey (Double shot of whiskey)
They know me and the story of Jack Daniels (aka Jack D).
At the bottom of the bottle, I don't miss you (Baby, you don't miss me)
Alcohol Kills Everyone in the Bar (Alcohol and Alcohol)
[after team]
Everyone in the bar started going crazy
Everyone in the bar is drunk.
[Sell]
Too busy bro.
