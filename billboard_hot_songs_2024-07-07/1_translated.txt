[Salmo 1: Post Malone]
You're so scared, aren't you, honey?
I was shocked that you made me.
You tell all your friends I'm crazy
Like I'm alone
Why are they so high?
Are you growing two hairs?
Sit in your big greenhouse
i thought you knew
[Chorus: Send Malone]
I have help
I can't handle this mess myself
Don't pretend you're not helping me get this bottle off the shelves
It's deep every week, you never know.
They say: “Teamwork makes dreams come true.”
Hell, I had some help (help)
[Cross-post: Post-Mallon]
(Help)
[Part 2: Morgan Wallen]
You thought you were blaming me when we broke up
Walk around like you're innocent
The game you were playing is lost.
I think this appeals to you, don't you?
Do you think you are innocent?
After all the stupid things you've done
I am not an angel, you are not sent from heaven.
We cannot wash our hands of it
[Reference: Morgan Wallen]
I have help
I can't do this mess alone.
Don't act like you won't help me get that bottle off the shelf
If I didn't know, I would have been in deep trouble every weekend.
"Teamwork makes dreams come true," he says.
I need help (help)
[Cross: Malone's post]
(help)
(Help)

[Ponte: Morgan Wallen,
post malone

Oba

It takes two to break a heart, oooh
Boy, I blame you, boy, you blame me
Oh, if it ain't true (
Oh

[Corey: Send iMalone to Morgan Wallen]
I have help.
It's not like I can screw this up on my own.
Don't do it in a way that doesn't help you get that bottle off the shelf.
If you don't know, I dig every weekend
People say: "Cooperation makes dreams come true"
Damn, I got help (help)
