[Verse 1]
It can't be said I'm an early bird
It's 10 o'clock before I say a word
Baby, I can never tell
How do you sleep so well?
You keep tellin' me to live right
To go to bed before the daylight
But then you wake up for the sunrise
You know you don't gotta pretend
Baby, now and then
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you just wanna wake up, dark as a lake
Smellin' like a bonfire, lost in a haze?
If you're drunk on life, babe, I think it's great
But while in this world
[Chorus]
I think I'll take my whiskey neat
My coffee black
and my bed at 3
You're too sweet for me
You're too sweet for me
I take my whiskеy neat
My coffee black and my bed at 3
You're too sweet for mе
You're too sweet for me
