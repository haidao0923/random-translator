[1. verse: Post Malone]
You do have nerves, don't you, honey?
I took the sidewalk only because you made me
You tell all your friends I'm crazy
Like I'm the only one
Why did you stand them as?
Got a messy hair or two? Live in your own big glass house with a view
I thought you knew
[Chorus: Post Malone]
I had help
I don't think I could make such a mess myself
Not if you didn't help me get that bottle off the shelves
I used to go there every weekend in case you hadn't noticed
They say "teamwork makes dreams come true"
damn i got help (help)
[Chorus: Post Malone]
(Help)
[2. verse: Morgan Whalen]
You thought I would take responsibility for our breakup
You walk around like you've done nothing wrong
You have already lost the game you won
I think it will catch you, hey
You think you are so innocent
After all the stupid things you've done
I am not an angel, you are not a gift from heaven
We can't wash our hands of it
[Chorus: Morgan Wallen]
I had help
I can't even make such a mess
You don't if you didn't help me get the bottle off the shelves
I've been diving every weekend in case you hadn't noticed
They say "teamwork makes dreams come true"
damn i got help (help)
[Chorus: Post Malone]
(Help)
(Help)
(Help)

It takes two to break a heart, oops
Baby you owe me and baby I owe you
Oh, if it's not true (
I see

[Chorus: Post Malone & Morgan Wallen]
I had help
I can't make such a mess myself
You don't if you didn't help me get the bottle off the shelves
I used to go there every weekend if you haven't noticed
They say "teamwork makes dreams come true"
damn i got help (help)
[Chorus: Post Malone]
(Help)
(Help)
