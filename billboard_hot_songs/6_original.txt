[Intro]
Do it, baby, do what I should think
Do it, do it, baby, do what I could think
Do it, do it, baby, do what I should think
Do it, do it, baby, do what I could think
Do it, do it, do it, baby, do what I should think
Do it, baby, do what I could think
Do it, do it, do it, baby, do what I should think
Do it, do it, baby, do what I could think
[Chorus]
I ain't never rep a set, baby (Tsk, tsk)
I ain't do no wrong
I could clean up good for you
Oh, I know right from wrong
'Cause I wanna make it so badly
I'm a million-dollar baby,
don't at me
Yeah, oh, hell no (Yeah, yeah)
[Verse]
You rep my city for so damn long (Ah, ah)
But you still don't notice me, my sound next
VA next (Yeah, yeah), I'm at they neck (Yeah, yeah)
I'm running up a check (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
She a bad lil' mama, she a diva
No matter what happens, he cannot come between us again
I know we're better than friends (Better than friends)
I took her to
Queen's Gambit
(Yeah, yeah), showed around my friends
Tried to pick some energy up, it don't matter
I know you haven't moved on if you tried (Oh, no)
I don't believe it, baby, I know you lied (Oh, no)
All night long, what you mean I changed?
Haven't stayed the same
I've been losing my mind (Ooh)
I said the city is mine (Ooh)
