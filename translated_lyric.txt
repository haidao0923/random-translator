The snow is white on the mountain tonight
Not a trace
Empire of Solitude
I feel like a queen


The wind howls like a raging storm within
I couldn't help it, God knows I tried
Don't let them in. don't let them see
Be the good girl you always needed to be.
Hide, don't hear, don't let them know
Well now you know


Leave it, leave it
I can't do this anymore.
Dead, dead
come back and knock on the door
I don't care what they say
Let the storm roll on
A cold has never bothered me.


Funny how distance makes everything look so small
The fear that once controlled me no longer affected me
Time to see what I can do.
Check and press the limits
For me, there are no right or wrong rules
How about peanuts?


let it be Let it be
I am one with the air and the sky.
Let it go
You can't see me cry
Here I stand Here I stand
Let the storm pass


My power flows through the air into the earth.
My soul is scattered everywhere in frozen parts
And the idea crystallized like a frozen explosion.
I never go back, the past is the past


Barry A Barry
When I rise like the dawn
let go
The perfect girl is gone
Here I stand in the daylight.
Let the storm roll
The cold never bothered me
